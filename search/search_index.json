Civic Technology, best defined as technology that catalyzes civic participation and increases government performance (e.g. service delivery and city responsiveness), is a nascent field that possesses untapped potential. Microsoft specifically created the Microsft Cities team to: Understand how society and its use of technology is changing and Aid cities as they make this transition to a \u201cdigital government\u201d platform. Within the \u201cCivic Tech\u201d movement, there are multiple opportunities for change: open data and transparent government, easier access to tech and infrastructure and tools, 21st century skill for all populations, sustainable cities and robust civic tech communities (e.g. hacker events). Microsoft Cities\u2019 approach to fostering innovation and growth in this sector is to provide research on the implications of policy and society, facilitate partnerships across 501c3s, academic institutions, government organizations and private civic tech companies, and connect with the greater community in each city to crowd-source solutions to technical problems. To contextualize Microsoft Cities' impact, some previous initiatives include: providing monetary grants to community partners, supporting innovative government organizations that utilize technology, granting hard/software to civic tech start-ups, assisting with computer science education initiatives, creating an online, interactive \u201cCivic Graph\u201d to illustrate the civic tech community and working with Science Museums to provide STEM/STEAM opportunities.

Civic Graph shows who\u2019s who and what\u2019s what in the growing field of civic technology. It is an open source, crowd-sourced knowledge base and data visualization project. It aims to map the civic tech community players and connections -- their types, locations and levels of influence in an interactive, intuitive, and modern way. Technical Breakdown Civic Graph is built in three parts: Civic-Graph-UI: Angular.js (v1) and D3.js - https://github.com/MicrosoftTCE/civic-graph-UI Civic-Graph-API: Python (v3) - https://github.com/MicrosoftTCE/civic-graph-API Azure hosting Civic Graph UI The UI front-end is built with Angular.js (v1) and D3.js for the network graph visualization. Civic Graph graph nodes represent entities, which could consist of people or organizations involved in the field of civic technology. The links among the entities represent the types of relationships or connections these entities share. Filtering options provide a unique method for visualizing certain aspects of the civic technology space. Type of Entities Color Representation For-Profit Green Non-Profit Blue Government Red Individuals Orange Type of Connections Color Representation Funding Red Data Blue Employment Purple Collaboration Orange Civic Graph API The API back-end is built with Python and serves information from a SQL database. API links: - http://api.civicgraph.io/api/entities - http://api.civicgraph.io/api/connections - http://api.civicgraph.io/api/categories Azure Hosting The fullstack application is hosted on Azure cloud . Our services are listed under the Civic-Graph resources froup. Local Environment Setup UI setup Most updated instructions can be found on the Civic Graph UI Github repo: https://github.com/MicrosoftTCE/civic-graph-UI All changes made to setup instructions should be made in the Github repo. API setup Most updated instructions can be found on the Civic Graph API Github repo: https://github.com/MicrosoftTCE/civic-graph-API All changes made to setup instructions should be made in the Github repo. Troubleshooting What happens when something breaks in Civic Graph? The following are best practices and suggested steps as per previous experience. Our services are hosted in the \"South Central US\" datacenters. This is automatically assigned and as far as we know, based on answers from Azure technical support, there is no way to change this. Very rarely does Azure go down but checking the Azure status page is a simple first step to take in case there is an issue with Azure. Link: https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/status/ Diagnose: If Azure status is all good, begin diagnosis. Is this a UI issue or an API issue? UI issues include position of elements being off, text displayed incorrectly, etc. API issues include data on graph not appearing or graph not appearing at all. UI issues can be tied into API issues. For example, if the graph keeps loading and does not display any content, this is an API issue with failure to render on the UI. UI issue If the issue is with the UI: Checkout master branch for the UI repo and create a new git branch with the name of the issue Serve the app locally and try to replicate the UI problem on your local environment Test any proposed changes to fix the problem locally Once you're satisfied with the changes, commit and push them to your new branch Create a Pull Request to merge into Master and have it reviewed to merge into az-prod branch API issue To check for an API issue, inspect the page using Google Chrome Developer Tools. If there are any red warnings, click on them to review. Usually, API issues are related to the API code breaking, database not updating, or a break in the link to the API. Check the API links above to see if any return an error. To diagnose an API issue further, you want to go to Azure portal and check the logs as follows: Go to Resources Civic-Graph or Link Click into the Civic-Graph-API Web service On the left sidebar, select Diagnose and solve problems Search for \"failed request tracing logs\" Select the most recent log with a failed status code of 400 or 500 Read through the trace log and see if there is a line that the API is failing at. You will need to go through the API source code and find that line to start applying a fix. Further Technical Support If you still need help diagnosing a problem and you have searched through all available (online) resources, you can open a support ticket via Azure for Azure technical support to assist. Your mileage may vary with how far someone will go to help you and you can always submit more than one ticket if you don't feel the issue has been resolved. Make sure to note everything you have tried so far. SQL Database The database for Civic Graph API is hosted on ClearDB. It would be best to host under Azure DB instead but this has sufficed for now. Credentials for the database via ClearDB can be accessed via LastPass. Registrar This project is registered under Namecheap. Credentials to access Namecheap are available via LastPass.

It is best to discuss, early on, with the directors of your program to best understand the goals that they have in mind, as well as to convey what you personally hope to seek from the program. Regardless of your focus, communication of your role within Microsoft is beneficial to both Microsoft in terms of broadcasting Cities\u2019 mission and yourself. Personal gain can be had in the form of additional contacts, expanding your professional network, as well as creating opportunities for dialogue with regards to your work. Such discussions are both beneficial in terms of acting as a foil, shining new light on current endeavors, as well as creating potential for future suggestions and direction on a project. Ongoing technical projects will require dedicated time to test, validate, and maintain overall to ensure everything is working as expected. Projects vary from fellow to fellow and it is important to understand the scope of the technical project and ask as many questions as necessary before, during, and after the project to successfully maintain it. Your best resources will be project documentation and current and/or past fellows whom have worked on the specific technical project. You likely have been engaged already in the civic technology field. If so, continuing with the enthusiasm that brought you to Microsoft in the first place will provide shine both yourself and Microsoft in the best light during your tenure. If you have not had prior experience in the civic technology space, then welcome. A plethora of resources are available to new individuals interested in the field, and Microsoft is a great jumping point from which to access them. At the New York branch of Microsoft Cities, Civic Hall is an amazing resource. This is where the New York program works out of on many days and where most major civic tech events take place, from Code for America\u2019s local New York brigade (discussed in detail in the below) to events such as Fast Company\u2019s Innovation Week. You will have access to Civic Hall as a member to participate in events and work out of the space throughout the year.

It is best to discuss, early on, with the directors of your program to best understand the goals that they have in mind, as well as to convey what you personally hope to seek from the program. Regardless of your focus, communication of your role within Microsoft is beneficial to both Microsoft in terms of broadcasting Cities\u2019 mission and yourself. Personal gain can be had in the form of additional contacts, expanding your professional network, as well as creating opportunities for dialogue with regards to your work. Such discussions are both beneficial in terms of acting as a foil, shining new light on current endeavors, as well as creating potential for future suggestions and direction on a project. Ongoing technical projects will require dedicated time to test, validate, and maintain overall to ensure everything is working as expected. Projects vary from fellow to fellow and it is important to understand the scope of the technical project and ask as many questions as necessary before, during, and after the project to successfully maintain it. Your best resources will be project documentation and current and/or past fellows whom have worked on the specific technical project. You likely have been engaged already in the civic technology field. If so, continuing with the enthusiasm that brought you to Microsoft in the first place will provide shine both yourself and Microsoft in the best light during your tenure. If you have not had prior experience in the civic technology space, then welcome. A plethora of resources are available to new individuals interested in the field, and Microsoft is a great jumping point from which to access them. At the New York branch of Microsoft Cities, Civic Hall is an amazing resource. This is where the New York program works out of on many days and where most major civic tech events take place, from Code for America\u2019s local New York brigade (discussed in detail in the below) to events such as Fast Company\u2019s Innovation Week. You will have access to Civic Hall as a member to participate in events and work out of the space throughout the year.

Tech Jobs Academy is an innovative approach to a hard problem: the skills gap. The program is a framework through which talented people acquire in-demand IT skills, enabling them to gain employment with local businesses \u2013 including the hundreds of thousands of Microsoft partner companies worldwide \u2013 in need of precisely these 21st century skills. Tech Jobs Academy was created for those who have everything but opportunity. The program aims to expand access to in-demand technical training to unemployed or underemployed adults who are passionate about launching careers in technology. Tech Jobs Academy employs a hybrid learning model that blends hard skills and soft skills, pairing a focus on real-world projects with labs, lecture, and certification exams. Throughout the program, each participant completes roughly 1,000 hours of high-quality skills development. During Tech Jobs Academy's pilot iteration in New York City, Microsoft collaborated with the Mayor's Tech Talent Pipeline and the New York City College of Technology to deliver Cloud and Server Administration skills to 50 trainees who had been carefully selected from over 500 applicants. Participants gained deep subject matter expertise and had the opportunity to become Microsoft Certified Professionals (MCP), Microsoft Certified Solutions Associates (MCSA), and Microsoft Certified Solutions Experts (MCSE), which have been shown to increase employability and compensation. In addition to the specific IT skills gained, graduates developed strong collaboration skills and technical writing abilities. Highlights The TJA playbook can be viewed here: http://techjobsacademy.com/playbook.pdf Each cohort of 25 trainees attended classes full-time over the course of four months. Of those who began the program, 94% graduated. For context, only 59% of matriculating U.S. college students ultimately finish. Tech Jobs Academy graduates\u2019 new job titles include Cloud Engineer, System Administrator, and IT Specialist; they work at Xerox, the AntiDefamation League, and the City of New York, among others Earnings jump over 5x (from $9k to $47k), lifting people out of poverty and into the middle class in a matter of months, not years. Technical Breakdown The repo for TJA is hosted on Github at the following link: https://github.com/MicrosoftTCE/tech-jobs-page TJA is hosted on Github (not Azure) and is a front-end website (HTML, CSS, Javascript) with Mailchimp list integration for signups (available via LastPass). Local Environment Setup To make changes locally, clone the repo and access the index.html page from your browser or launch from a local server. Deployment To push changes to production, create a new branch and submit a pull request to the gh-pages branch. Once the pull request has been reviewed, it can be merged and the changes should be available within a minute (depending on Github replication).
